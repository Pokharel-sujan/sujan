Mode	Definition
r	Read mode: if the file name does not match any known file, raises IOError. Handles the data as characters.
w	Write mode: if the file name does not match any known file, creates a new file. If it does, empties the file before writing. Handles data as characters.
a	Adding mode: if the file name does not match any known file, creates a new file. If it does, adds the new text to the end of the existing file. Handles data as characters.
rb	bit-read: if the file name does not match any known file, raises IOError. Handles the data as bit values.
wb	bit-write: if the file name does not match any known file, creates a new file. If it does, empties the file before writing. Handles data as bit values.
